**Software is a catalyst for social change.** I aspire to drive innovation by implementing technological solutions to positively impact lives and communities.

It's great to see you! I'm **Thiago Poiani**, a **software developer**, and through persistent endeavor, my mission is being achieved at [SkipTheDishes](https://skipthedishes.com), a leading global online food delivery marketplace.

Working in the Dispatch Logistics Team, our challenge is to revolutionize _"order delivery"_ by maintaining geographic systems designed for scalability and reliability, contributing to efficient work for couriers, and customer satisfaction.

Furthermore, my professional and academic backgrounds were essential factors in defining my purpose, as some of my past experiences also had social impacts:
- [Lady Driver](https://ladydriver.com.br), the largest female transportation app in Latin America, provided extra income for families and safety for passengers;
- I was one of the authors of a published case study on how the collaborative mapping activities that followed the Nepal Earthquake in 2015 were coordinated and structured.

To pursue these personal values, I will evolve my hard and soft skills, diving into software architecture and sharing knowledge in events and trainings. I also impact the people around me, being an engaged, supportive and loving father and husband.
